Set up is super easy!

1. Open a new Unity3d project.
2. Create a primitive GameObject (a capsule is perfect), or you can use your own model. 
3. Make sure that the camera in your scene is tagged "Main Camera".
4. Right-click in your project panel to create a new c# script and name it "ThirdPersonController".
5. Copy/paste the code provided in this folder in the place of all of the text in the script you just created. 
6. Press play and go nuts!
